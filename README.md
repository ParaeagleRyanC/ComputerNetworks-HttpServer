# HTTP Server

HTTP is a text-based protocol that runs on top of TCP. This program is a simple application that supports `GET` requests. When the client requests file over **Chrome** or other `HTTP` platforms, such as **CURL** and **Postman**, the server properly digests the request by examining the headers and returns appropriate information, either the `requested file` or `404 NOT FOUND`.

This program demonstrates the knowledge of HTTP protocol and familiarity with file I/O and relative file paths.
